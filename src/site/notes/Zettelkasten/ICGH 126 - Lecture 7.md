## Moral Hypocrisy
- Advocating moral principles, but do not behave accordingly.
- Appearing to be moral without bearing the actual cost of being moral.

> We judge our own unethical behaviors and other's unethical behavior's differently.
> This is a case of *double standards*.
### Examples:
- Parents always tell us not to talk when we are eating dinner, but they also say "listen to me when I talk".
- A supervisor always complain, telling us not to be late to work, stick to company rules, but they always come late.
- There was an experiment to ask people who are smoking to offer a lighter to a kid who needs it for smoking. All the people which were asked did not offer the lighter and instead lectured the kid about why smoking is bad, listing all the harmful things about it. Then they were questioned why *they* smoke. They smoke despite knowing that it is super harmful and they wouldn't allow a kid to do it.

> Q: How can people appear moral to themselves when they fail to act morally?

Two possibilities:
- Misperceive one's behavior as moral.
- Avoid comparing one's behavior with moral standards.

___
### Case study: Batson

People were asked to choose a task for themselves and one other participant. Here is all they were shown:

2 tasks to choose for you and the other person
1. Boring and tedious task, no reward
2. Easy and you get 30$

**Results**:
- 80% of the people picked the second option.

The participants were then asked to rate how ethical they were, they were asked the following:

Rate the ethicality of your choice
Ethical or Unethical?

It turns out that most of the people rated what they did as "*ethical*".

**A twist: coin toss**

People were asked to do a coin toss to determine who gets the task.

**Results**:
- 50% of the people used the coin toss.
- The other 50 claimed that they *used* the coin toss. They cheated.

Afterwards,  participants were asked to rate themselves and once again everyone rated themselves as being ethical even if they actually cheated. They did not compare their behavior with the moral standard.

## Virtue

> What is a good person? 
> How do you know that a person is good?


# Forces Behind Dishonesty (Cont.)
## Being Depleted
- No x and z => V depletion => V Cheating
- No a and n => ^ depletion => ^ Cheating

Easy => Less cheating
Hard => More cheating

### One immoral act
- Cloè Sunglasses
	- Two groups of people, one wearing real authentic Cloè, the other one wearing fake ones.
	- Ask both group to perform to matrix task.
	- The people with authentic Cloè cheated less and the people with the real one cheated more

	People wearing authentic Cloè:
	- Less cheating
	- Likely to be honest
- People wearing fake Cloè:
	- More cheating
	- Less likely to be honest

### Self deception
Self deception happens when one individual believes that they can do more than they can actually do. (This sounds a little off)

- IQ test + Access to the answer key
- Predict your own performances in the next IQ test.
- Given that the individual can achieve 50% and 25% with the help with the answer key, when asked to predict their own score on the next exam, they predict 75% as opposed to what they can actually achieve.

>Is there a relationship between creativity and dishonesty?

Divide people into two group

Group one:
- Construct a grammatically correct 4 word sentence. 

Group two:
- The same but with words like 'new', 'ingenious', 'imagination', 'ideas'....

> Which department is more creative?
> Accounting or design?

Employees in an advertisement agency were surveyed. They picked two specific department. The accounting and the design department. They found out that the accounting people cheated less.

> Finding: Intelligence has nothing to do with dishonesty.

## Infection

This is when an individual's bad behavior infects others. Like one person perhaps cheats and causes everyone else to cheat as well.

|Condition|Problems Solved|
|-|-|
|Control|7|
|Shredder|12|
|Infection-Insider|15|
|Question|10|
|Infection-Outsider|9|

The infection insider is perhaps like someone part of the same university.
The outsider is like a student from a different university.

As you can see, when the infection is caused by an insider the cheating rate is highest.

### Question

>Question: "Can't I just say I solved everything and walk away with the cash."
>Answer: "You can do whatever you want."

Why does this decrease the number of cheating?
- This makes you confused. In the case where you don't ask, you don't have to consult or ask anyone. But when someone tells you to "do whatever you want", you have to think about what you do.

How likely will you cheat in the take-home exam?
- Your friend in the same class.
- Your friend from a different class cheat.
- Someone in the same class cheats.
- Someone from a different class cheats.

### Collaboration
> Altruistic Cheating -> Others benefit from our dishonesty.

Matrix task -> 2-person team.
Each is paid half of the team's total earning.

When cheating benefits others, this causes people to cheat even more. This is probably because they can justify their own action.

Working with a distant and unknown partner who might benefit from our cheating.
- More cheating.

Working with a monitor who does not talk to us.
- Less cheating.
- When someone stares at you, you feel more on edge, more uncomfortable.

Working with a monitor with whom we are becoming friendly.
- More cheating.

Working with a distant and unknown partner who only benefits from our cheating.
- More cheating.
- Super altruistic.

## Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC)
Benefits > Prob(Costs) => Cheat

Other factors:
- Conflict of interest.
- Depletion.
- Self deception.
- Creativity.
- Others benefitting from cheating.
