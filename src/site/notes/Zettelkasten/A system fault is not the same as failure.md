# A system fault is not the same as failure

When we refer to a [[Zettelkasten/System fault\|system fault]], we refer to the fact that there is a component which is not behaving as expected. When we refer to a [[Zettelkasten/System Failure\|system failure]], we are talking about how the system as a whole stopped functioning completely, failing to service the user.
