# Subtle Bond

Subtle bonding is like linking one person to another in some way. Like, having both of them be aware that they were born on the same date (even if it isn't true).

**Setup**: Take 20 math questions in 5 minutes then self-report how much you got.

After 1 minute, an actor who is part of a subtle bond would declare that they solved everything.

Interestingly, the partner which they bonded with would also cheat.
