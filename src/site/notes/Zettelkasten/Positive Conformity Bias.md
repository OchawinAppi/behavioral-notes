**Setup**: In a hotel, this sign was setup:

> HELP SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT
> The environment deserves our respect. You can show your respect for nature and help save the environment by reusing your towels during your stay.

This resulted in 35% reuse.

In some other room this was set up

> JOIN YOUR FELLOW GUESTS IN HELPING TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT 
> Almost 75% of guests who are asked to participate in our new resource savings program do help by using their towels more than once. You can join your fellow guests in this program to help save the environment by reusing your towels during your stay.

This resulted in 45% reuse.
