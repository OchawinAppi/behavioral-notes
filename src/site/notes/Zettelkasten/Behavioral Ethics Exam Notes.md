2. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.2 Transparency|Transparency]]: People behave less ethically when their actions are not transparent. (not seen)
3. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.3 Fatigue|Fatigue]]: People behave less ethically when they are under the effects of fatigue.
4. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.4 Cleanliness|Cleanliness]]: People behave less ethically when they are in a dirty environment.
```

## 1.1 Time Pressure

When people are rushed, or are under any sort of time pressure, they tend to act more rash. People are more likely to act unethically under time pressure.
### 1.1.1 Case Study: Good Samaritan

A group of students were taught about the good Samaritan story from the Bible. This is a story about a traveler who was robbed and beaten, left half dead alongside the road.  A priest and a Levite pass by without helping him. But a Samaritan stops and cares for him, taking him to an inn where the Samaritan pays for his care. The students were asked to reflect on the story and make a presentation about it. The students were then asked to walk to another building, where the presentation is supposed to take place. Unbeknownst to the students, the professor hired an actor (confederate) who pretended to be hurt on the sidewalk.

Three sections of the class were taught.
- First section: 
	- The professor said that there was no need to hurry.
	- 63% of the students helped the confederate.
- Second section
	- The professor said that they should hurry because there is an audience waiting for them.
	- 45% of the students helped the confederate.
- Third section
	- The professor said that they were late and had to run.
	- 10% of the students helped the confederate.

Clearly, under time pressure the students were less likely to help the confederate.
## 1.2 Transparency

People are more likely to act *unethically* if they feel like their actions are not acknowledgeable.

Many factors can make an action less transparent.
- Physical factors like lighting or visibility.
- Lack of observers.
- Anonymity.

### 1.2.1 Case Study: Dim/Bright

Students were tasked to solve 20 math problems and self check their answers, and they will be rewarded some cash for each answer they get correctly.

In a bright room, 24% of the students cheated.
In a dim room, 61% of the students cheated.

> [!question] Why would people lie in a dim room even though everything is still visible?
> This is due to the effect of [[Zettelkasten/Illusory Anonymity\|illusory anonymity]].  This is when an individual thinks that others can't see them clearly because *they* can't see others clearly.
> 
> This effect even works when wearing sunglasses.

### 1.2.2 Case Study: Being Watched

At a university a professor made a little coffee station for other professors to used. The professor then put down a box so that other professors can pay for their coffee. It was observed that there were multiple occasions where the payment was neglected. In order to combat people not paying, the professor tried putting an image of eyes on the wall.  Over some period of time the picture was alternating between pictures of flowers and pictures of a pair eyes.

It was then shown that statistically, weeks with the pairs of eyes as the posted image had a larger average sum of money.

> [!question] Why would a picture of a pair of eyes affect the sum of money?
> The posted image made people feel *seen*. When people feel seen they become more aware of their own doings and this causes them to behave more ethically.
