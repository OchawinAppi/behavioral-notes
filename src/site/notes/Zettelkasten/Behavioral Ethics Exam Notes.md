# 1. Situational Factors

```ad-tldr
title: Key Ideas
There are four main situational factors.
1. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.1 Time Pressure|Time Pressure]]: People behave less ethically under time pressure.
2. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.2 Transparency|Transparency]]: People behave less ethically when their actions are not transparent. (not seen)
3. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.3 Fatigue|Fatigue]]: People behave less ethically when they are under the effects of fatigue.
4. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#1.4 Cleanliness|Cleanliness]]: People behave less ethically when they are in a dirty environment.
```

## 1.1 Time Pressure

When people are rushed, or are under any sort of time pressure, they tend to act more rash. People are more likely to act unethically under time pressure.
### 1.1.1 Case Study: Good Samaritan

A group of students were taught about the good Samaritan story from the Bible. This is a story about a traveler who was robbed and beaten, left half dead alongside the road.  A priest and a Levite pass by without helping him. But a Samaritan stops and cares for him, taking him to an inn where the Samaritan pays for his care. The students were asked to reflect on the story and make a presentation about it. The students were then asked to walk to another building, where the presentation is supposed to take place. Unbeknownst to the students, the professor hired an actor (confederate) who pretended to be hurt on the sidewalk.

Three sections of the class were taught.
- First section: 
	- The professor said that there was no need to hurry.
	- 63% of the students helped the confederate.
- Second section
	- The professor said that they should hurry because there is an audience waiting for them.
	- 45% of the students helped the confederate.
- Third section
	- The professor said that they were late and had to run.
	- 10% of the students helped the confederate.

Clearly, under time pressure the students were less likely to help the confederate.
## 1.2 Transparency

People are more likely to act *unethically* if they feel like their actions are not acknowledgeable.

Many factors can make an action less transparent.
- Physical factors like lighting or visibility.
- Lack of observers.
- Anonymity.

### 1.2.1 Case Study: Dim/Bright

Students were tasked to solve 20 math problems and self check their answers, and they will be rewarded some cash for each answer they get correctly.

In a bright room, 24% of the students cheated.
In a dim room, 61% of the students cheated.

> [!question] Why would people lie in a dim room even though everything is still visible?
> This is due to the effect of [[Zettelkasten/Illusory Anonymity\|illusory anonymity]].  This is when an individual thinks that others can't see them clearly because *they* can't see others clearly.
> 
> This effect even works when wearing sunglasses.

### 1.2.2 Case Study: Being Watched

At a university a professor made a little coffee station for other professors to used. The professor then put down a box so that other professors can pay for their coffee. It was observed that there were multiple occasions where the payment was neglected. In order to combat people not paying, the professor tried putting an image of eyes on the wall.  Over some period of time the picture was alternating between pictures of flowers and pictures of a pair eyes.

It was then shown that statistically, weeks with the pairs of eyes as the posted image had a larger average sum of money.

> [!question] Why would a picture of a pair of eyes affect the sum of money?
> The posted image made people feel *seen*. When people feel seen they become more aware of their own doings and this causes them to behave more ethically.

### 1.2.3 Case Study: Shame or Honor

Participants were given money and asked to donate to the public. The caveat was that the identity of the participant who contributed the *most* would be revealed. In this case, it would be an *honor* to be acknowledged. Another group of participants were asked to do the same, but the caveat was different. For the second group the identity of the participant who donated to least would be revealed.

> [!question] Which caveat was more effective?
> As it turns out, both methods yielded similar results. There was not much difference.
## 1.3 Fatigue

People are more likely to behave unethically under the effects of fatigue.
It is a known fact that [[Zettelkasten/Sleep deprivation has negative effects\|sleep deprivation has negative effects]]. (less self control, more hostile, more deviant)

### 1.3.1 Case Study: [[Zettelkasten/Morning Morality Effect\|Morning Morality]]

Students were asked to perform visual tasks on computers then self report the results of their tests, with each correct answer being rewarded. Half of the students performed the test in the morning and the other half performed the test in the afternoon.

> [!question] Which group lied more?
> People cheated more in the afternoon. (about 20% - 50%)
## 1.4 Cleanliness

People are more likely to behave unethically in a dirty environment.

### 1.4.1 Case Study: Graffiti and Littering

This experiment was conducted in a public bike parking area. After people left their bikes, a note would be attached onto their bicycle saying *'we wish everybody happy holidays'*. On some days the bike parking area was clean and on others the wall was full of graffiti. For the day that the wall was clean, 33% of the people threw away the note on the ground. 

> [!question] Which day had more littering?
> For the day that the wall had graffiti, 69% of the people threw the note on the ground.

# 2. Social Pressures

```ad-tldr
title: Key points
There are two main social pressures.

1. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#2.1 Obedience To Authority|Obedience to authority]]: Under the influence of a figure of higher authority, people can be forced to act unethically.
2. [[Behavioral Ethics Exam Notes#2.2 Conformity Bias| Conformity bias]]: People will act more/less ethically depending on the actions of others. Dishonesty is infectious.
```

## 2.1 Obedience To Authority

Under the influence of someone with authority, people are more likely to act unethically if tasked.

> [!example] Example: Unethical Orders
> When you are asked to do something by a figure of authority, sometimes you just can't say no.
> - Your boss tells you to cheat the records of sales.
> - Your mother tells you to cash in a suspicious check.
> - A researcher telling you (a participant) to electrocute an animal for the sake of their study.
>   
> As you can see the role of an authority may vary from context to context.
> - Your mother.
> - Your boss.
> - etc.
### 2.1.1 Drunk on Power

Under the influence of power (the power of being an authority), people are more likely to abuse their power.

> [!example] Example: The Stanford Prison Experiment
> A group of students were split. Half were acting as prisoners and the other half were acting as guards. As the study progressed, the guards became increasingly sadistic and the prisoners became increasingly submissive.

## 2.2 Conformity Bias

People will behave more/less ethically depending on the action of others.

> [!example] Example: Are these people just dumb? Or is it me?
> 6 participants were asked to judge a series of images of lines and match them to a set of lengths. They were asked to shout out their answer. Five of the participants were confederates. The subject was placed at the end of the line so that they could hear the first five answers. All the actors were tasked to answer incorrectly on purpose.
> 
> In the first few rounds most participants did not yield, but after a few more most participants would conform to the group's incorrect answer, even if they know full well that it is wrong.
> 
> It was also shown that when given a partner who would answer correctly as well (go against the group), the subject would be able to muster the courage to answer correctly.

### 2.2.1 Other people are doing it, why don't I

 If you know that other people are doing something unethical, you are more likely to do it as well, because you can justify it by saying that other people do it.
 
> [!example] Example: It's okay, other people do it too.
> At a national park, tourists often took petrified wood as a souvenir back (they are not supposed to). To combat this, a sign was put up, reading "There has been a lot of pilfering, please refrain". This had the opposite effect and it increased the pilfering by 300%. This happened because now people know that others are doing it.
> 
> The sign was then later changed to "Collecting petrified wood is prohibited" and that reduced pilfering.


### 2.2.2 In-Group vs Out-Group

When people are in groups they are more likely to cater their ethical behavior to fit the group.

> [!example] Splitting money and T-shirts
> Students were split into two groups, wearing two different T-shirts. Money was given each student and they were asked to pair up with another person from the other group and decide how much money to give to the other person. A confederated was planted and was tasked to publicly declare that he was going to *"give nothing"* and *"take everything"*.
> 
> As a result, people who were in the same group as the confederate shared less money and people from the opposite group were less dishonest.
### 2.2.3 Subtle Bonds

Subtle bonding is like linking one person to another in some way. Like, having both of them be aware that they were born on the same date (even if it isn't true). If the person you have a bond with cheats, then you are more likely to cheat as well.

> [!example] Example: My long lost brother is *that guy* who finishes first in the exam
> Participants were take 20 math questions in 5 minutes then self report how much they got. After 1 minute, an actor who is part of a subtle bond formed before the exam would declare that they solved everything (which is impossible).
> 
> Note: the bond was formed by the having the participant answer a questionnaire and telling them something like "Oh! You were born in the same month as \<insert name here>\"
> 
> As a result, the person they formed the subtle bond with was more likely to cheat as well.

### 2.2.4 Positive Conformity Bias

Just like how conformity bias can influence you to do bad things, it can be used for good.
### 2.2.5 Other people are doing it, why don't you?

Knowing that others are doing something, then being questioned why *you* don't do it makes you more likely to do it.
 
> [!example] Example: Use the stairs !
> A sign was put up in a building saying "*Did you know? More than 90% of the time, people in this building uses the stairs instead of the elevator. Why not you?*". This decreased elevator usage by 46%.
