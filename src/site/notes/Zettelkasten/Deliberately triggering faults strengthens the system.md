# Deliberately triggering faults strengthens the system

It may seem counter-intuitive at first, but actively triggering [[Zettelkasten/System fault\|system faults]] can lead to better [[Zettelkasten/System fault\|fault]] tolerant systems. Many critical bugs are actually the result of [[Zettelkasten/System faults should be handled properly\|poor error handling]]. By deliberately triggering [[Zettelkasten/System fault\|faults]], you can ensure that your system has been tested. 

Since your system has been tested before, you can be confident that it will hold up when a [[Zettelkasten/System fault\|system fault]] occurs naturally.

A way to think of it is like playing chess practice matches in order to prepare for the real game.
