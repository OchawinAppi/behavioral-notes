# ICGH126 - Lecture 5 - See No Evil


## 1. Motivated Blindness

Business Context -> Conflict of interest.

A study by Bazerman in 2002:
- People were asked "what is the worth" of some imaginary company. Half of the people were assigned the role of a buyer and the other half was assigned the role of a seller.
- "You are assigned to buy it, what do you think is the value of this company?"
- "You are assigned to sell it, how much do you think the company is worth?"
- The people who were assigned the role of the seller generally estimated a higher price than the estimated price of the buyers. This makes sense because each party were motivated by the role they were assigned to. The seller would like to make the most value out of it and the buyer would like to get it for as cheap as possible.

Some contexts:
- Politics
- Families
- Friends

### Case Study: Toy Toy
Toy Toy is a famous actor who killed his girlfriend, the crazy thing is that many people came out and supported him because they are blinded by his standing. A TV show even went to jail to interview him.

> When we have a self-interest in a situation/person it is very difficult to assess the ethicality.

## 2. Indirectness

Indirectness is when you achieve some benefits by having someone else perform the unethical action for you instead of doing it yourself.

Example:
- Banks don't collect debt from people directly, they hire debt collectors. They outsource this action to disassociate themselves with the nation of "bad".

SINGHA owns LEO (Oh my god)

Singha and Leo both have advertisements for their soda water because when people see it they think about the beer. Since beer advertisement is illegal in Thailand, the only way to advertise it is via indirection.

> When unethical behavior is indirect is is difficult to assess.

## 3. Slippery Slope

**The boiling frog syndrome**:
- A frog is able to adapt to the water boiling but before it knows it, it has doomed itself without ever knowing because it didn't know when to jump.

> "Let us jump when we still have the strength"
> -- Some random video

> We frequently fail to notice unethical behaviors if they are **gradual changes**. We don't focus.

The invisible gorilla is a good example of how when we focus too much on one thing, we are unable to retain our perception.

### 3.1 Small changes vs big changes

Experiment:
- People were asked to look at a jar and decide whether they approve of the estimated value. There were two groups, A and B, A was shown the jar with small changes and B was shown with big changes. Team A approved way more than team B.


### 3.2 Until Bad Things Happen

> "It's not illegal if I don't get caught"

If there are two companies manufacturing the exact same product which kills people, if a case of an injury were to happen with A but not with B, we would think that B is better because nothing bad has happened. Though, objectively speaking, A and B are both equally bad.

> People often judge the ethicality of actions based on whether harm follows, rather than on the ethicality of choice itself.

> "We are waiting for bad things to happen, and as long as nothing bad happens yet, it is a good thing"
> -- Aj Yingyot

### 3.3 Legacy Admission

Ivy Leagues have so called *legacy admissions*, where people essentially bribe their way into higher education. This is not illegal and they think it's fine because *nothing bad happened yet*.

Example: Thai School Milk:
- There have been cases of rotten milk but nothing bad has happened yet, so they continue to distribute it.

### 3.4 Many People versus Single

If you can identify a person, if you could clearly express the impact of something it will be more successful.

Example:
- Asking for money to help MANY people afford education. No so successful.
- One person asking for money so they can afford education. Very successful.

## Assignment #4
- Elaborate one "See No Evil" error that caused **YOU** to overlook others' unethical behavior.
- Motivated blindness
- Indirectness
- Slippery slope
- Until bad things happen
