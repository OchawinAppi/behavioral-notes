# A distributed system if more reliable than a local system

There are many different advantages which makes [[Zettelkasten/Distributed Systems\|Distributed Systems]] more [[Zettelkasten/Software Reliability\|reliable]] than single systems. 

One of the advantages which it has over a local system is that a [[Zettelkasten/Distributed Systems\|distributed system]] isn't dependent on a single computer. Since the work is distributed throughout many different nodes, if one were to fail, the rest would still be able to function normally. In contrast, in a local system, if the lone computer hosting the server were to malfunction, the server would inevitably go down along with it.
