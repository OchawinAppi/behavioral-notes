## Lecture 3

> "I don't think so."
> -- Aj, Yingyot

- Obedience to Authority
	- Authority can influence you to do bad things, and you just can't say no.
- Conformity

## Lecture 4 - Cognitive Errors
- **People have a tendency to believe they are more ethical than they actually are, which inclines them to make decisions with serious ethical implications.**
- Caution: Don't be too overconfident in your self control.
**Framing**:
- Even though two things can be the exact same thing we tend to favor the one that is framed better. 
- Example:
	- 90% Survival rate vs 10% Mortality Rate
	- Lying vs not telling the truth
	- Corruption vs business practice
- Frame could also refer to reference. This is like viewing from the perspective of the consumer (customer) vs from the perspective of a business owner.
- Case study:
	- Daycare -> Fine for coming late
	- By taking a fine for parents coming to pick their child up late, more parents actually come late. This is because they see the fine as a "payment"  for having the daycare take care of their children. They framed it as such.
- **Loss Aversion**
	- We **hate** losing assets, we will always try to minimize the chance of a loss.
		- +900 vs 90% prob of +1000 ===> Pick the +900 for sure.
		- - 900 vs 90% prob of - 1000 ===> Take your chance and pick the second option.
	- Case study
		- Two different groups, they have to solve math problems and self report
		- Group A: "gain" -> gain 1 dollar per correct answer
		- Group B: "loss" -> lose 1 dollar per wrong answer
		- Which group lied more? It was *group B*, this is because of loss aversion!
- **Incrementalism**: Start from a small lie.
- The slippery slope in which one gets used to minor wrong doings and does not notice when one gives way to major ones.
- **Tangible & Abstract**:
	- Example: False financial statement
		- Tangible:
			- Stock prices
			- Job losses
		- Abstract:
			- Getting caught?
- **People remember immediate and tangible factors at the expense of more remote and abstract factors.**
- **Self-Serving Bias**
	- **People gather/process information in a self-serving way and fail to see and/or object to unethical behavior that serves their self-interest.**
- Home work topics:
	- Overconfidence
	- Framing
	- Self-Service
	- Tangible and abstract
	- Incrementalism
