# Authority can influence you to do bad things

In the experiment where participants had to ask questions and minister a shock depending on the correctness of the answer, with each shock being more and more deadly, more than 60% of the participants went all the way. This means that they ministered a shock level that *is* fatal on purpose, under the presumption that it was for research.
