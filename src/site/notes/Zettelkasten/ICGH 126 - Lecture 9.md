# ICGH 126 - Forces Behind Dishonesty

There was a gift shop in the JFK Center for Performing Arts
- There were 300 volunteers working. (Mostly retirees)
- In this gift shop there is no cash register.
- The amount of money was roughly $400,000.
- $150,000 was missing when the value was checked against the stock.

## Why do we cheat?
- Simple model of Rational Crime
	- Benefit that one stands to gain from the crime.
	- Probability of getting caught.
	- Expected punishment if one is caught.

If you decide to steal something, the benefit is clear. The probability is implicitly 100%. Even though the cost is always greater than the benefit, the probability of getting caught is not 100%.

The formula:
> Benefit = (Prob.) Cost

Examples:
> P(Benefit) > P (Cost) -> Cheat.
> P(Benefit) < P (Cost) -> No cheat.

## Control Condition
- This is the number that people can achieve something on average. For example, for the matrix task, people on average can do about 4.
## Shredder Condition
- The shredder condition basically allows you to cheat because there is a way to get rid of the evidence of cheating. By lowering the probability of getting caught, people are more likely to cheat.
- The average number became 6. (Thanks to people cheating)
## Self Paying Condition
- (Same matrix task) Now, the teacher is not present in the room and there is a cash bowl in the front of the room for people for to grab the amount they earned.
- This makes the probability of getting caught even less, because now the professor won't even be aware of how much money is taken. There is no chance for the professor to suspect anyone.
- The average number of tasks people claim to finish is still 6.

> Lower probability does not lead to more cheating.

### More money -> More Cheating? No.

In the matrix task, when the price was raised the probability of cheating is still the same, up until $10, contrary to popular belief the chance of people cheating actually decreased.

This is the case because the higher the value, the more guilty people felt about cheating. If you were to take away like $2 or $3 it wouldn't feel much like cheating because how much you take away doesn't seem that substantial. However if you were to steal, say, $30 then you would feel like you really are cheating.

### Distance From Money -> Less Cheating?  No.

Now we change from giving away money to giving away tokens which could be converted into cash. Now the benefit is not as clear so people cheat *less*, but people cheat more!

## Drawing A Line
- Not telling the whole truth.
- Telling a lie that benefits others.
- Telling a lie that makes me better off.
- Telling a lie that does not hurt anyone.
- Telling a lie that intends to hurt others.

Consider:
- Taking 10 baht from your mother's purse.
- Taking 5000 baht from your mother's purse.

Even though these two are actually the same thing, you don't feel the severity of the first case.


## Lost Wallets Experiment
- A professor dropped 17,303 wallets all over the world, in 355 cities in 40 different countries. Each wallet has a business card, so that the finder is able to contact the owner.
- Switzerland had the best return rate 80%!
- Thailand 30%.
- Lowest in the world is China, 15%.

Half of the dropped wallets had money.

Wallets with no money should see a higher return rate, as opposed to wallets with money which should see a lower return rate, however this was the opposite of what happened. If there was money inside of the wallet less people stole it.

This is because if they really took the wallet with the money, it is considered *stealing*.
