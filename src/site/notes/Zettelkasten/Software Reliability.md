# Reliability for software

When we say that a piece of software system is reliable, we refer to the expectation that the system should continue to work properly even under unexpected/unusual circumstances.

Expecting the system to work properly means that the system should meet the performance and functional expectations.

Unexpected circumstances might be something like invalid user input, unusually heavy data volume, or even hardware/software faults.

A reliable system is expected to comply to the following points:
- Systems are expected to function as expected.
- The system is expected to be able to tolerate user errors.  (invalid usage/input)
- The performance is as expected with respect to the load and data volume.
- Security is properly enforced. Unauthorized access and abuse is prevented.

> tldr: "it should work correctly, even when things go wrong".
